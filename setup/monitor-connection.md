# Monitor Connection

For regular use, you'll want to plug the Raspberry Pi in to a visual display: a monitor or a TV.

## HDMI Port

The Raspberry Pi has a HDMI port which you can plug directly into a monitor or TV with an HDMI cable. This is the easiest solution; some modern monitors and TVs have HDMI ports, and some do not, but there are other options:

### DVI

For monitors with a DVI port, you can use an HDMI-to-DVI cable.

### VGA

For monitors with VGA only, you can use an HDMI-to-VGA adapter. We suggest using only powered HDMI-to-VGA adapters (with an external power source). Using an unpowered adapter may damage your Pi and therefore is not advised.

## Composite Port

For analogue TVs you can use a standard RCA composite video lead. The B+ and Pi 2 Model B do not have the large composite port, but can still be used with an analogue TV by plugging in to the 3.5mm socket that is also used for audio: you'll need a 3.5mm composite video/audio lead.

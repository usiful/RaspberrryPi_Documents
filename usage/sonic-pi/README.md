# Getting started with Sonic Pi

Sonic Pi is an open-source programming environment, designed for creating new sounds with code in a live coding environment; it was developed by Dr Sam Aaron at the University of Cambridge. He uses the software to perform live with his band. This resource will help get you started with the basics of Sonic Pi so that you can code your own music.
